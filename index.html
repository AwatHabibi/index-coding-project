  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello, My name is <em>Awat Habibi</em>. I was born in Portland Maine, but my family is from eastern Kurdistan which is <strong>occupied </strong> by Iran. I moved to Portland Oregon when I was 13 years old. I graduated from WIlson high school and then went to college for business development. While I was in college I left my job as a manager for a sprint store and started working for a bank. I worked my way to the possition of Sr. Relationship Manager, Officer. However, I didn't find my life fufilling so I dropped out of college and recently left my job. I decided to take a class for coding because I felt that it would fit my lifestyle better. I also find it far more interesting than finances. I have big goals and aspirations so knowing how to code/develop my own apps and websites will be invaluble for me.</p>
