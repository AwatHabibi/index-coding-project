  <h1>A-what?</h1>
  <p>Hello, My name is <em>Awat Habibi</em>. I was born in Portland Maine, but my family is from eastern Kurdistan which is <strong>occupied </strong> by Iran. I moved to Portland Oregon when I was 13 years old. I graduated from WIlson high school and then went to college for business development. While I was in college I left my job as a manager of a sprint store and started working for a bank. I worked my way to the possition of Sr. Relationship Manager, Officer. However, I didn't find my life fufilling so I dropped out of college and recently left my job. I decided to take a class for coding because I felt that it would fit my lifestyle better. I also find it far more interesting than finances. I have big goals and aspirations so knowing how to code/develop my own apps and websites will be invaluble for me.</p>
  <h2>Intrests and Hobbies</h2>
  <p>My intrests and hobbies are always changing but one has remained constant for as long as I can remember is standing up for oppressed peoples all over the world. <span class="highlight">As a Kurd my family has suffered through systematic oppression, racsism, a plethora of human right violations, and genocide.</span> When I was a child my parents would tell me what my family and people go through. I remember when I was seven and asked my parents if we could go to Washington, D.C. to protest the leader of Iran coming to the United States and they took me. From that point on speaking out on injustes of the world became second nature to me. I also really enjoy volunteer work and helping those in need. This pandemic I worked with non-profits and local state/city officails to provide PPE to businesses to keep their employees and the community safe. I also was able to help about fifty business stay open by getting grant money to pay for some of thier bills and fees. One of my greatest accomplishments was getting 1.3 million dollars to local minority owned busnesses to help them grow in a managable and eco friendly way. Eventhough it's great to help people there are also times you have to help yourself. Here is a list of what I like to do when I get the chance.</p>
