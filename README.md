### This a simple website using HTML code and CSS stylesheet to test my understanding for Epicodus.
### In this project we were tasked to create a website with the following; The following HTML tags are all used: p, h, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, img, div, and span. Project includes a custom-made stylesheet that uses typography styles, the box model (including margin, border, and padding), and floats. Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools. Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It will…". The project repo contains a README that includes: application name, names of contributors, description of application, link to site on GitHub Pages, a "technologies used" section, application setup instructions, link to site on GitHub Pages, a "known bugs" section, copyright, date, and license information.
